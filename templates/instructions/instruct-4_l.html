            A ROBOTIC COACH will now provide feedback to help you drive on BLACK ICE.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The car will change color to indicate SPEED UP or DOWN, which means to press either up arrow or down arrow. A sequnce must be learned to hanndle the BLACK ICE
        </p>

        <p>
            Please try to FOLLOW the coach's advice. NOTE the coach is LEARNING as well and may NOT be always RIGHT.The coach will be learning to reinforce good controls, so its important that you try different commmands (i.e. pressing up and down) during the black ice part.
